    <h1>KNOW YOUR RIGHTS (JUA RIGHTS ZAKO!)</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Officer Identification:</strong> You can politely ask the officer for their name and badge number. (Note it down if possible).</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Know Why You're Stopped:</strong> You can ask the officer for the reason for the stop or the alleged offence.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Dignified Treatment:</strong> You have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, without harassment or intimidation. (Derived from Constitutional rights).</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Refuse Unlawful Searches:</strong> Police generally need a warrant or probable cause to search your vehicle. You can state, "Officer, I do not consent to a search of my vehicle." (Note: This is complex; further details may be needed for specific situations).</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Remain Silent (Regarding Allegations):</strong> After providing your required documents (driving license, insurance, etc.) and identifying yourself, you are generally not obligated to answer further questions that might incriminate you regarding an alleged offence before speaking to a lawyer. You can politely state you wish to remain silent or speak to your lawyer.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Official Fine Process:</strong> You have the right to pay official fines through designated channels (e.g., eCitizen). You are NOT obligated to pay "unofficial" cash fines on the spot.</li>
